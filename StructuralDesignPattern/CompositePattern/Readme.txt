Composite Design pattern---->
	Consider an example of assembling a computer-
						Computer
				Cabinet			Peripheral devices
		Hard drive	Motherboard		Mouse		Keyboard
		
		
	Composite design pattern is the pattern where you create the structure in a tree form.
	An object is composite which composed of multiple objects.
	
	So his tree like structure will have leaf nodes as well.
	So the operation that you can perform on leaf node, same u should be able to perform on composite objects as well.
	In the above example, if u can get the price of keyboard /mouse, then u must be able to get the price of peripheral devices
	and s a result of the computer.
	
	Composite design Pattern is used to create a tree structure of objects.
