Adapter design pattern---

	Take an example , you have iphone 6s, and you went to your friend's place and now your phone 
	got discharged and u want a charger . You asked your friend but he has a charger of iphone 4s as he has iphone 4s.
	The charger for iphone 4s has a bigger slot ,so it cannot be fit in your 6s.
	
	So now to cherge you need a connector that can connect iphone 4s charge to your iphone 6s.
	So that connector is called adapter.
	Adapter is also called as Wrapper.
	It acts as intermediate.
	
	
	Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern, that is used to make the two unrelated interfaces work together.
	The object that do so is called adapter(intermediate)
		
	One of the great real life example of Adapter design pattern is mobile charger.
	Mobile battery needs 3 volts to charge but the normal socket produces either 120V (US)
	or 240V (India). So the mobile charger works as an adapter between mobile charging socket and the wall socket.
	
	We can make the use of the existing interface that is incompatible with our interface.
	Adapter helps in making it compatible.
